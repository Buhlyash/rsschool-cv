### About myself:

In the middle school i enjoyed informatics class, where we often write some simple programs. 
So i decided that i want to learn more programming. On both school exams I chose informatics 
to pass and went to university to be program engineer. At the moment i am student of fourth 
course. As for work experience,  i passed production practices in the company called ITerritory, 
which i ended successfully. For my coursework i made mobile app Pomodoro for Android. My aim 
to become not only professional Front end developer, but excellent program engineer and expert
in information technology. My priority is doing things that i interested in. In my opinion, 
my strong sides are  fast learnability, assiduity and responsibility.
